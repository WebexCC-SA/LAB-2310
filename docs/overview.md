# Overview

## Learning Objectives

This lab session is an entry-level session for engineers who want to learn about the voice channel and its related troubleshooting techniques in a Webex Contact Center Solution. The session is divided into three exercises that cover the following topics:

- **Configure and manage inbound call flows**: Participants will learn to set up inbound call flows with specific features like whisper announcements and distribution strategies.

- **Debug and troubleshoot common issues**: The lab will focus on using tools like flow debuggers to identify and fix configuration errors, whether in inbound flows or outbound dialing setups.

- **Handle call transfers and data preservation**: Participants will gain experience in ensuring a seamless call transfer process that maintains crucial data (flow variables) for agents.

- **Analyze agent performance**: The exercises will allow participants to use call reports to understand and analyze agent behavior, helping them identify the root cause of specific call events like rejections or "Ring No Answer" (RONA) events.

- **Set up outdial capabilities**: The lab will cover the process of configuring a system to enable agents to make outbound calls.

Essentially, the lab is designed to give participants a holistic view of the call center solution, from initial setup and configuration to troubleshooting complex issues and analyzing performance related to the voice channel
